           <p class="mb-4"> {/* Added bottom margin */}
            If you become a Fosslink customer and utilize our home automation installation and related services, we will necessarily collect data related to the setup, configuration, and operation of your installed system to provide the service. This typically includes device identifiers, network information, status data (e.g., light on/off), configuration settings you choose, and diagnostic information for support.
           </p>
           <ul class="space-y-2 mb-4"> {/* Added space between list items & bottom margin */}
             <li>Device identifiers, types, models, and network information.</li>
             <li>Device status (e.g., light on/off, lock locked/unlocked, sensor active/inactive).</li>
             <li>Environmental data from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion detection logs - content depends on specific devices installed).</li>
             <li>Automation routines, schedules, and scene configurations you create.</li>
             <li>System logs, error reports, and diagnostic information for troubleshooting and support.</li>

We strive to minimize data collection to what is necessary for providing and improving the service. Data such as video or audio recordings from cameras or microphones is handled with heightened security and access controls, typically processed locally or encrypted in transit/rest if cloud storage is used (details provided during setup).
